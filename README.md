PDiff3
======

The spiritual descendent of @netspooky's pdiff2; there were features I wanted
to add to pdiff2, but i'm also totally neurotic and wanted it to be pep8
compliant and easier to distribute (e.g. include a requirements.txt at least,
and perhaps get published as a pip package)

So here we are. With thanks and apologies to @netspooky <3


Setup
-----

Prerequesites: python3, wireshark are installed

```
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
-----

```
./pdiff3 INPUT_FILE
```
